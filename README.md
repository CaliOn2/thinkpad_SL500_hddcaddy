# thinkpad_SL500_hddcaddy
A hdd Caddy for the sl500 thinkpad because its cheaper than shelling out 10$ for the dwindeling amount on ebay.

this is a modified version of the t410 caddy design linked here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1711214

print should be made of petg as it's made of some very thin parts, PLA UNTESTED!!!
no need for supports, has been tested at 100% infill but less is probably very possible as it doesen't have to be very tough in the walls
